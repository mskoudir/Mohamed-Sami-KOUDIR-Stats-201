# Data Folder Structure

The data folder contains the dataset used for analysis. Please refer to the data README for details on the dataset and its structure.

#### **Data Folder**

- **Download Data**: For this example, I'll use a dataset from UCI's ML Repository. You can select a dataset related to social science (e.g., the "Adult Income Dataset").
- **Folder Structure**: In the `data` folder, add a `README.md` and a `data_dictionary.csv` file.


# Dataset: Adult Income Dataset

The Adult Income dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains demographic information used to predict whether a person makes more than $50K a year based on features such as age, education, occupation, etc.
