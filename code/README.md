# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Income Prediction

This repository contains the code to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Adult Income dataset. The analysis includes both numerical and categorical feature exploration, correlation analysis, and visualizations to uncover patterns in the data.

## Code Overview

- **Data Loading**: Loads the dataset (`adult_income.csv`).
- **Missing Value Analysis**: Identifies missing values in the dataset.
- **Feature Distribution**: Visualizes the distribution of numerical and categorical features.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Displays the correlation between numerical features.
- **Income-Based Analysis**: Boxplots and pairplots to explore how features relate to income levels.
- **Visualization Tools**: Uses `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization.

## Running the Code

1. Ensure the dataset (`adult_income.csv`) is located in the `/data` folder.
2. Run the notebook in Jupyter or any other Python environment with the necessary dependencies.
   
For more details on the dataset, refer to `data/README.md` and `data/data_dictionary.csv`.
