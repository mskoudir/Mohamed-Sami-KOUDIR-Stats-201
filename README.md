# Social Science Machine Learning Research

This repository contains the code and data for exploring machine learning techniques applied to social science datasets. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the analysis.

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Social-Science-ML-Research.git
cd Social-Science-ML-Research
```

### 2. Create a Conda environment
Create a new Conda environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
conda create --name ml-research python=3.8
conda activate ml-research
```

3. Install required dependencies
Install the necessary Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include the following dependencies (for example):
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
You can now launch the Jupyter notebook to run the analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the code/analysis.ipynb notebook to start working.

## Cloud Setup (Google Colab)

If you prefer using Google Colab, follow these steps:
1. Upload the repository to your Google Drive
Upload the repository to your Google Drive (either as a zip file or directly via GitHub integration).
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab
Navigate to the uploaded notebook folder in your Google Drive and open the analysis.ipynb notebook.
3. Install dependencies in Colab
Once the notebook is open, run the following cell to install the required dependencies:
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
